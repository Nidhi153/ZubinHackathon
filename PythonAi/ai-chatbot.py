        Classification: Classify user prompts into one of the following three categories based on the content of the prompt:

        FAQ: If the user is seeking information, clarification, or has a general inquiry, classify it as "FAQ".
        CANCEL: If the user intends to cancel or withdraw from an event or activity, classify it as "CANCEL".
        REGISTRATION: If the user expresses interest in signing up, registering, or joining an event or activity, classify it as "REGISTRATION".
